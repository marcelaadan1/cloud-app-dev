# Exercises Guide Overview

This course includes the following exercises:

#### [Exercise 1. Getting started with Cloud Foundry apps on IBM Cloud](workshop/exercise-1.-getting-started-with-cloud-foundry-apps-on-ibm-cloud.md)

This exercise describes how you can deploy a web app without downloading or configuring a runtime environment, a framework, or setting up a server. This exercise also covers how to test and run the app when it is deployed.

#### [Exercise 2. Developing IBM Cloud applications with IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery](workshop/exercise-2.-developing-ibm-cloud-applications-with-ibm-cloud-continuous-delivery.md)

In this exercise, you will explore DevOps capabilities in IBM Cloud. You work with the IBM Cloud Continuous Delivery services to explore, develop, build, and deploy IBM Cloud applications.

#### Exercise 3. IBM Cloud with Cloudant

This exercise demonstrates how you can create a Cloudant database service on IBM Cloud without installing or configuring the database instance on your workstation. You use an HTTP API client such as Postman to create, read, update, and delete Cloudant documents. You create indexes and query data by using Cloudant API end points.

#### Exercise 4. Securing a web application with single sign-on \(optional\)

In this exercise, you secure an application by using the App ID service for single sign-on by authenticating your application through trusted server providers.

#### Exercise 5. Managing IBM Kubernetes Service clusters

This exercise demonstrates how to create an IBM Kubernetes Service cluster and manage it by using the kubectl CLI.
